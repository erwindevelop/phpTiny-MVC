# phpTiny-MVC

This is a small MVC project that I have been working on.
It uses Eloquent as its ORM and Twig as its templating engine. Both are very well documented.

### Prerequisites

You will need NPM and Composer to install dependencies.

### Installing

Just clone the repo, run 

```
npm install
```

and then

```
composer install
```

### Webpack!

All source files (we're using Sass) are in the assets folder. We are using Webpack to compile CSS and JS. Just run

```
npm run build
```

### Inspiration

This is loosely based in Laravel. I have always really enjoyed the modular approach that Tyler went with. So, I thought I would try a very watered down version with no bells or whistles. Taylored just for my site and my needs.

I think it is a good starting point for any smaller site if you are interested in the MVC design pattern.
